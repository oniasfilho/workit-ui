## Technologies Used

- **React.js (Vite)**: A fast and optimized development setup for crafting high-performance UI components.

- **TypeScript**: Added static typing to JavaScript, making development more predictable and reducing potential runtime errors.

- **CSS3**: Utilized for layout and styling, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase.

- **CSS Variables**: Implemented design tokens for consistent styling and easier theme management.

- **Mobile-First Approach**: Designed and developed with a mobile-first mindset, ensuring an excellent experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

- **Key CSS Techniques applied in this project**:
  - **Custom Clipping and Background Effects**: The `upper-section::before` uses a `clip-path` with an elliptical shape to create a dynamic background transition.
  - **Custom Hover Effects**: The `.green-underline` class utilizes `text-underline-offset`, `transform`, and `transition` properties to create a smooth interactive experience.
  - **CSS Aspect Ratio Management**: The `.founder-image` uses `aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;` to maintain a responsive image ratio.
  - **Z-Index Stacking and Positioning**: The `.cta-content` and `.cta-content::before` elements use absolute positioning with `z-index` to layer elements effectively for a unique visual effect.
  - **Adaptive Layout with `min-width` Variables**: The project applies `--min-width` in the `:root` for a more flexible and scalable responsive design.
